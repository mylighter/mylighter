# Self Introduction
I'm a Chinese student in Grade 8. I sometimes make something to simplify my coding process or learning process in python.

My coding experience in coding is really poor, so if there's something wrong in my program, it's normal. And I will appreciate you if you tell me the problem and help me to solve it.
